Follow the video till the server is set up in pgAdmin4. <br>
1) Create the database by right clicking the databases dropdown under server.  <br>
2) Give the database name and click save. <br>
3) In the django settings look for DATABASE key and replace this with <br>
```
DATABASES = {
    "default": {
        "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.postgresql",
        "NAME": "<your database name>",
        "USER": "<user_name>",
        "PASSWORD": "<password>",
        "HOST": "127.0.0.1",
        "PORT": "<port_number>",
    }
}
```
Remember the password and the port number with which you set up the database server. <br>

10) Open the file **load.py** in the **scripts folder** in **app folder**.<br>
11) Change the path of the four files **routes.csv,stops.csv,stop_times.csv,trips.csv** in load.py file. You can find these files in the root directory of the repository.<br>
12) Perform migrations and migrate the model to Postgres database.
    ```
    python manage.py makemigrations
    ```
    ```
    python manage.py migrate
     ```
13) Run the command from navigating to the root project directory in the terminal. <br>
    ```
    python manage.py runscript load

14) If you require to decide to change the model after setting up the database server use the command prompt in pgAdmin4 using SQL commands to view the metadata of the table. <br>
    Make sure to do changes in Postgres schema using SQL commands then perform migrations on the model and then load the data.<br>
    You can access postgres terminal by clicking the database in the pgAdmin server and then click on the rightmost button **>_** icon to open the terminal. Here you can write SQL commands to change the schema of the database already set up. Access these tables created by migrations using **<app_name>_<model_name>**.<br>
